<h2>Itertools module</h2>
<p>You are already familiar with iterators and know how to create an iterator from a list or other iterable objects. In this topic, you will learn how to create iterators from multiple collections (e.g., two lists) with the help of the methods implemented in the <strong><code class="language-python">itertools</code></strong> module.</p>

<p>The <code class="language-python">itertools</code> module contains some useful iterator building blocks. To use its functionality, you will need to import the module first:</p>

<pre><code class="language-python">import itertools</code></pre>

<h5 id="itertoolschain" style="text-align: center;">itertools.chain()</h5>

<p><code class="language-python">itertools.chain(iterable1, iterable2, ...)</code> is handy when you need to treat a number of consecutive sequences as a single sequence. The code below prints out the names of all the students taking different subjects:</p>

<pre><code class="language-python">students_maths = ['Ann', 'Kate', 'Tom']
students_english = ['Tim', 'Carl', 'Dean']
students_history = ['Jane', 'Mike']

for student in itertools.chain(students_maths, students_english, students_history):
    print(student)

# Ann
# Kate
# Tom
# Tim
# Carl
# Dean
# Jane
# Mike
</code></pre>

<p>So, the <code class="language-python">itertools.chain</code> takes a number of lists (or any other iterables) as input and returns an iterator that returns the elements from the first list one by one until the list is exhausted, and then proceeds to the second one and so on until all the lists are exhausted.</p>

<p>Note that this approach is different from concatenating all the lists first and then looping over the resulting list because <code class="language-python">itertools.chain</code> doesn't actually create this intermediate concatenated list and therefore saves up memory.</p>

<p>The <code class="language-python">itertools</code> module implements other useful combinatorial functions, such as <code class="language-python">product()</code> and <code class="language-python">combinations()</code>.</p>

<h5 id="itertoolsproduct" style="text-align: center;">itertools.product()</h5>

<p>Another useful tool is the <code class="language-python">itertools.product(iterable1, iterable2, ...)</code>, which takes several iterables and returns the elements of their Cartesian product one by one. Cartesian product of several iterables is an iterator of all possible tuples such that the first element is coming from the first argument, the second element is coming from the second argument, and so on. Here is an example:</p>

<pre><code class="language-python">first_list = ['Hi', 'Bye', 'How are you']
second_list = ['Jane', 'Anton']

for first, second in itertools.product(first_list, second_list):
    print(first, second)

# Hi Jane
# Hi Anton
# Bye Jane
# Bye Anton
# How are you Jane
# How are you Anton</code></pre>

<p>Again, note that these combinations are not stored in memory but produced on-the-fly, only when the <code class="language-python">for</code> loop asks for a new one. This is especially important when you work with a lot of data. Compare:</p>

<pre><code class="language-python"># Trying to create a list containing 10^12 elements will result in a memory error:
too_long_list = list(itertools.product(range(1000000), range(1000000)))

# However, works with iterators:
my_iterator = itertools.product(range(1000000), range(1000000))
for i in range(5):
    print(next(my_iterator))

# (0, 0)
# (0, 1)
# (0, 2)
# (0, 3)
# (0, 4)
</code></pre>

<h5 id="itertoolscombinations" style="text-align: center;">itertools.combinations()</h5>

<p>Imagine that you need to obtain all possible combinations of <code class="language-python">r</code> items from an iterable containing <code class="language-python">n</code> elements.</p>

<p>For example, let's consider all possible combinations of any two numbers between 1 and 1000000. There are so many of them it's practically impossible to fit in memory. How to deal with this problem? Use iterators!</p>

<p> <code class="language-python">itertools.combinations(iterable, r)</code> does exactly what we want. Take a look at the example:</p>

<pre><code class="language-python">my_iter = itertools.combinations(range(1, 1000000), 2)

for i in range(5):
    print(next(my_iter))

# (1, 2)
# (1, 3)
# (1, 4)
# (1, 5)
# (1, 6)
</code></pre>
