    bytes would be ordered too.
- text: It specifies the display mode. In case of <code>'little'</code>, only ASCII-characters
    are printed, 'big' allows to show any character.
- text: It allows to convert characters to lower- and uppercase (<code>'little'</code>
    and <code>'big'</code> respectively) before conversion to bytes.
- text: 'It specifies the order in which the bytes should be printed: from the least
    significant byte to the most significant one in case of ''little'', and vice versa
    for ''big''.'
